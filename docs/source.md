The [VulkanSceneGraph project](https://github.com/vsg-dev) is composed of the main VulkanSceneGraph library and a series of additional projects that provide further capabilities.

## Main repositories hosted on vsg-dev

The three main reposititories that most users will use are VulkanSceneGraph, vsgXchange and vsgExamples.

* [VulkanSceneGraph](https://github.com/vsg-dev/VulkanSceneGraph.git) : the main scene graph library
* [vsgXchange](https://github.com/vsg-dev/vsgXchange.git) Provides loading of a range of 3rd party image and 3d model files, and http/https support
* [vsgExamples](https://github.com/vsg-dev/vsgExamples.git) Collection of example programs that test VSG features and illustrate how they are used.

## Secondary repositories hosted on vsg-dev

The following repositories are part of the VulkanSceneGraph project and provide more specialized functionality.

* [MyFirstVsgApplication](https://github.com/vsg-dev/MyFirstVsgApplication) simple standalone application that can be used as a template for your own applications.
* [vsgQt](https://github.com/vsg-dev/vsgQt) Qt5/6 integration
* [vsgImGui](https://github.com/vsg-dev/vsgImGui.git) ImGui + ImPlot integrastion
* [osg2vsg](https://github.com/vsg-dev/osg2vsg.git) OpenSceneGraph integration
* [vsgPoints](https://github.com/vsg-dev/vsgPoints) point cloud rendering
* [vsgFramework](https://github.com/vsg-dev/vsgFramework.git) Framework project that uses CMake to compile a suite of projects associated with VulkanScenegraph

## Community projects

The wider VulkanSceneGraph community have published libraries and applications:

* [vsgCs](https://github.com/timoore/vsgCs) 3D Tiles and Cesium ion integration
